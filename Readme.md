## Simple apps

### Visual timer

Visual timer is an app that lets user create timers and displays a visual demonstration of time left along with percents and remaining time in seconds.

The app's logic is based on getting timestamps, so it will work if you switch to another tab. Also, all timers data are saving in local storage when you leave or refresh the page. HTML canvas is used for circle rendering.
